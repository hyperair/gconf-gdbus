    <abstract>
      <para>
        GConf is a system for storing configuration information, that is,
        key-value pairs. GConf provides a notification service so applications
        can be notified when a key's value is changed.  GConf also allows for
        pluggable storage mechanisms (text files, databases, etc.); allows
        administrators to install default values; and allows application authors
        to document their configuration keys for the benefit of administrators.

    <title>Introduction to GConf</title>

    <para>
      This chapter introduces GConf, including the basic terms and
      concepts. After reading it, if you're a GNOME programmer looking
      to dive in quickly, you might skip to <xref
      linkend="gconfclient-example"/>. If you want to have
      comprehensive knowledge of GConf, you might want to read the
      whole manual.

      <para>   
        GConf is intended to store key-value pairs, where keys are
        located in an infinite tree-structured namespace (similar to the
        UNIX filesystem). It offers several useful features:
        <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Users can select a variety of data storage backends, such as XML
              text files, ACAP, or databases (LDAP, DB, etc.). This makes it
              easy to adapt GConf to local needs. It also avoids the age-old
              "text files vs. binary registry" debate. (Note: the current GConf
              only has an XML backend implemented, other backends are easy to
              write though.)

            <para>
              GConf offers a notification service, so applications can 
              ask to be notified when the value of a key changes. 
              This allows settings to be applied to groups of
              applications, without restarting them and without 
              ugly hacks. It also allows a clean model-view
              architecture for applications.

              Each user has a "GConf search path" which is a list of 
              configuration sources to scan for each value. 
              For example, the configuration engine might look for 
              values first in the local machine's database and 
              then in a network-wide database.

              GConf is implemented as a per-user daemon, which makes 
              locking a non-issue and allows aggressive caching.

          <listitem>
            <para>
              The client API is simple and very abstract, which allows us to
              change its implementation at a later time without a big headache.
              Because a good implementation is a complex problem, this is
              important.

      <para>
        GConf was inspired by Wichert Akkerman's configuration
        system specification, originally developed for the Debian
        project. Other sources of ideas include the Windows registry,
        the ACAP specification, and Emacs customize mode (try typing
        <literal>M-x customize-browse</literal> in Emacs). Windows XP's
        registry has some features such as documentation that GConf has
        as well - maybe they copied GConf - hey, it's possible. ;-)

      <title>Terms and Concepts</title>

      <para>
        This section introduces the basic GConf structure and terminology.
      </para>

      <sect2>
        <title>Namespace</title>          
        <para>
          The GConf namespace is almost exactly like the UNIX filesystem; that
          is, a tree structured directory hierarchy. Each name is either a
          "file" (a configuration key storing a value) or a "directory" (a list
          of child configuration key names). A name is specified with a
          slash-separated path. A full path is referred to as a
          <firstterm>key</firstterm>.  Characters in a path should be
          alphanumeric or underscore. Path components may not start with a
          period. You should follow the conventions outlined in 
         <xref linkend="conventions"/> when choosing what names to use
          for your keys.
        </para>
      </sect2>

      <!-- Data Types -->
      <sect2>
        <title>GConf Data Types</title>

        <para>
          GConf can only store a small, fixed set of data types. This keeps the
          database implementation simple and efficient. GConf should
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> be used to store data files or any other
          large amount of information; <emphasis>it is designed for simple
          configuration data only</emphasis>. There are any number of better
          solutions available for storing documents and other large data
          chunks. You might want to store a filename, URL, or Bonobo moniker in
          GConf pointing to a larger piece of data, if you need the GConf
          notification facilities.
        </para>

        <para>
          Here are the GConf datatypes:
          <variablelist>

              <term>Integer</term>
              <listitem><para>

              handle.  </para></listitem>

            <varlistentry>
              <term>Float</term> <listitem><para> Float values are floating
                  point numbers.  Given differences between machine architectures

                  than "a reasonable degree."

      <!-- Sources -->
      <sect2>
        <title>Configuration Sources</title>

        <para> Users can specify <firstterm>configuration sources</firstterm>
          which will be used by the <application>gconfd</application> per-user
          configuration server.  <application>gconfd</application> loads the
          file <filename>/etc/gconf/2/path</filename> (or
          <filename>${sysconfdir}/gconf/${version}/path</filename>) on startup; this file
          contains a list of <firstterm>configuration source
          addresses</firstterm>.  A source address is similar to a URL; it
          contains a "protocol" name (in this case, the name of the backend to
          use), followed by a colon, standard flags separated by commands,
          another colon, and then backend-specific information. For example, the
          address <filename> xml:readonly:/home/hp/.gconf.xml</filename> refers
          to an XML backend file tree rooted at
          <filename>/home/hp/.gconf.xml</filename> that should be "mounted
          readonly" so that no data is written to it.
        </para>

        <para>
          <filename>/etc/gconf/2/path</filename> stores a list of
          addresses, which form a <firstterm>configuration source
          path</firstterm>. When looking up a value, GConf will begin
          with the first source in the path, and continue checking
          each source until the value is found or there are no more
          sources.  When setting a value, GConf will use the first
          <emphasis>writable</emphasis> source.  Administrators can
          impose <emphasis>mandatory</emphasis> settings on their users
          by placing only read-only configuration sources in the path, 
          or by placing a read-only source at the front of the path 
          and setting specific values in that source.
          Administrators can provide <emphasis>default</emphasis> values
          by placing a systemwide source at the end of the configuration
          source path.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          The source configuration file can contain "include" statements and
          some magic variables; you can use this to include a .gconf.path file
          from the user's home directory. Variables are placed in
          <symbol>$()</symbol>.  Two variables are built-in to GConf:
          <symbol>$(HOME)</symbol> is the user's home directory, and
          <symbol>$(USER)</symbol> is the username. You can also access any
          environment variable by prepending <symbol>ENV_</symbol> to the
          variable name. For example, <symbol>$(ENV_FOO)</symbol> will be
          replaced by the <symbol>FOO</symbol> environment variable.
        </para>

        <para>
          So once everything is working a
          <filename>/etc/gconf/path</filename> file might look like
          this:
          <programlisting>
            # GConf configuration path file with an include statement
            xml:readonly:/etc/gconf.xml.mandatory
            include "$(HOME)/.gconf.path"
            xml:readonly:/etc/gconf.xml.defaults
            # imaginary, no LDAP backend exists right now
            ldap::/foo/bar/whatever/ldap/address
          </programlisting>
        </para>

        <para>
          Note that particular backend modules may have their own special
          configuration. For example, you may need to configure the details of
          an LDAP backend.
        </para>

      </sect2>

      <!-- Schemas -->
      <sect2 id="concepts-schemas">
        <title>Schemas</title>

        <para>
          A <firstterm>schema</firstterm> describes some configuration
          key. Its primary purpose is to provide documentation about
          the key to system administrators manipulating the GConf
          database. Secondarily, schemas contain a good default value
          for the key; GConf will automatically return this value when
          a key is unset. Schemas also include the name of the
          application that created a key (useful when trying to clean
          old junk out of the database, for example).
        </para>

        <para>
          Schemas are normally installed from special schema
          description files; the <application>gconftool</application>
          program knows how to read these and install the schemas into
          the GConf database. Normally, schemas are not installed by
          application code, though the interface for doing so is a
          public part of the GConf API.
        </para>

  <!-- Client Library -->
  <chapter>
    <title>C Language Client Library</title>
    
    <para>
      The GConf client library is used by applications
      to store or retrieve configuration data. This library presents 
      the lowest-level (but still fairly convenient) mode of access
      to the GConf database; the GConf database does not speak a
      public protocol and can not be accessed directly. 
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that this is only a brief tutorial-style introduction to
      the client library; have a look at <xref
      linkend="gconf-reference"/> for a complete reference.
    </para>

    <!-- Error Handling -->
    <sect1>
      <title>Error Handling</title>
      
      <para>
        Error handling isn't exciting but it's unfortunately
        necessary. GConf uses the standard <symbol>GError</symbol>
        feature from GLib; if you have never read the documentation 
        on <symbol>GError</symbol>, you should do so right away.
      </para>

      <para>
        When using GConfClient routines, it's OK to pass NULL for the
        error argument most of the time; it has a default error handler
        that will be run.
      </para>

      <para>
        The available error codes are:
        <variablelist>

            <listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>
                Indicates that the operation fatally failed for 
                some fairly unpredictable and idiosyncratic reason
                not covered by the more specific error values.
                The error message will give details.

                The <application>gconfd</application> configuration server
                could not be contacted, and we couldn't or didn't
                respawn it for whatever reason. The error message 
                may give more details. This probably means either a
                bug in <application>gconfd</application> or a hosed local

      <para>
        <structname>GConfClient</structname> should be used instead of 
        <structname>GConfEngine</structname> in most applications.
        See <xref linkend="gconf-client"/>. Because libgnome uses
        <structname>GConfClient</structname>, apps using libgnome 
        <emphasis>MUST</emphasis> use
        <structname>GConfClient</structname>.
        <structname>GConfClient</structname> gets confused if you poke

      </para>

      <para>
        A <structname>GConfEngine</structname> object represents your
        connection to a configuration database. Normally the database
        you're connecting to is the user's default database, defined
        by all the sources in their configuration source
        path. <function>gconf_engine_get_default()</function> returns
        a handle to this default
        database. <function>gconf_engine_get_default_with_address()</function>
        returns a handle to a single configuration source; normally,
        applications will not use this function&mdash;it's intended
        for system configuration tools and the like.
      </para>

      <title>The <structname>GConfValue</structname> Datatype</title>
      
      <para>
        The <structname>GConfValue</structname> struct represents 
        a value that can be obtained from or stored in the
        configuration database. It is simply a type marker 
        and a union of several value types, with constructor,
        destructor, "setter" and "getter" functions. When possible 
        the GConf library allows you to deal with simple C types
        instead of a <structname>GConfValue</structname>, but 
        sometimes there is simply no way to know the type of an 
        object in advance. The <filename>libgnome/gnome-config.h</filename>
        interface simply returns strings in this case, for the
        programmer to parse manually; this was phenomenally broken and
        GConf fixes it with <structname>GConfValue</structname>.        
      </para>

        <title>Accessing <structname>GConfValue</structname></title>
        <para>
          To read a <structname>GConfValue</structname>, you first 
          determine its type and then read the value using one 
          of its accessor macros. The following useless code should 
          demonstrate this:
          <programlisting>

print_value(GConfValue* value)

            iter = g_slist_next(iter);
          }
      }
      break;
    case GCONF_VALUE_PAIR:
      print_value(gconf_value_get_car(value));
      print_value(gconf_value_get_cdr(value));
      break;
    case GCONF_VALUE_INVALID:
      /* This is used internally by GConf, you can also
         use it yourself to indicate errors and such. It
         won't be returned from GConf functions though. */
      printf("invalid value");
      break;

      <title>Schema File Format</title>
      <para>
        Here is a sample schema file for a hypothetical application, 
        <application>basic-gconf-app</application>, one of the
        examples that comes with the GConf distribution.
        <example>
          <title>Sample schema file</title>
          <programlisting>
&lt;gconfschemafile&gt;
    &lt;schemalist&gt;
      &lt;schema&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;/schemas/apps/basic-gconf-app/fooandbar&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;applyto&gt;/apps/basic-gconf-app/foo&lt;/applyto&gt;
        &lt;applyto&gt;/apps/basic-gconf-app/bar&lt;/applyto&gt;
      &lt;owner&gt;basic-gconf-app&lt;/owner&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;string&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;locale name="C"&gt;
        &lt;default&gt;Blah blah blurgh&lt;/default&gt;
        &lt;short&gt;short description in C locale&lt;/short&gt;
        &lt;long&gt;long description of foo and bar in C locale&lt;/long&gt;
      &lt;/locale&gt;
      &lt;locale name="no"&gt;
        &lt;default&gt;some thing in norwegian&lt;/default&gt;
        &lt;short&gt;short description in Norway&lt;/short&gt;
        &lt;long&gt;Long description in Norway. long long long. this is a long sentence.&lt;/long&gt;
      &lt;/locale&gt;
    &lt;/schema&gt;
      &lt;schema&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;/schemas/apps/basic-gconf-app/baz&lt;/key&gt;

        &lt;default&gt;Zzzzzzzzzz&lt;/default&gt;
        &lt;short&gt;short description in C locale&lt;/short&gt;
        &lt;long&gt;long description of baz in C locale&lt;/long&gt;

        &lt;long&gt;Long description in Norway. long long long. this is a long sentence.&lt;/long&gt;
      &lt;/locale&gt;
    &lt;/schema&gt;
      &lt;schema&gt;

      &lt;applyto&gt;/apps/basic-gconf-app/blah&lt;/applyto&gt;
      &lt;owner&gt;basic-gconf-app&lt;/owner&gt;

  &lt;/schemalist&gt;  
&lt;/gconfschemafile&gt;
          </programlisting>
        </example>
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The file format is straightforward. The root node must be
        called <literal>&lt;gconfschemafile&gt;</literal>. This
        element contains one or more <literal>&lt;schemalist&gt;</literal>
        elements; I can't think of a reason to use multiple
        <literal>&lt;schemalist&gt;</literal> elements, but you can if 
        you want, and <application>gconftool</application> will load
        each one. The <literal>&lt;schemalist&gt;</literal> in turn 
        contains one or more <literal>&lt;schema&gt;</literal>
        elements. Each of these describes a single schema.        
      </para>

      <warning>
        <para>
          <application>gconftool</application> is not very tolerant
          about whitespace right now; in particular it won't strip
          whitespace from around key names, type names, etc. This is
          broken and will be fixed, just watch out for now.
        </para>
      </warning>

      <para>
        Here are the fields of the <literal>&lt;schema&gt;</literal>
        element:

<informaltable pgwide="1" frame="none">
<tgroup cols="2"><colspec colwidth="2*"/><colspec colwidth="8*"/>
<tbody>

<row>
<entry>&lt;key&gt;</entry>
<entry>The key <emphasis>where the schema will be stored</emphasis>;
                  see <xref linkend="conventions"/> for naming
                  conventions. There may be only one key per schema.
</entry>

</row>

<row>
<entry>&lt;applyto&gt;</entry>

<entry>A key <emphasis>the schema will be applied to</emphasis>; that
                  is, this schema <emphasis>describes</emphasis> this
                  key.  See <xref linkend="conventions"/> for naming
                  conventions. There may be multiple &lt;applyto&gt;
                  elements.</entry>

</row>

<row>
<entry>&lt;owner&gt;</entry>

<entry>Name of the application that uses this schema; may be the
                  command line name, or a human-readable name. However
                  you should use the same value for &lt;owner&gt; for
                  all schemas your app installs. The primary purpose
                  of this field is to enable sysadmins to locate the
                  keys belonging to a given application.                  
                </entry>

</row>

<row>
<entry>&lt;type&gt;</entry>

<entry>The type of values described by this schema. i.e. keys 
the schema is applied to should store values of this type.
Allowed values are: <literal>string</literal>, <literal>int</literal>,
<literal>bool</literal>, <literal>float</literal>,
                  <literal>list</literal>, <literal>pair</literal>
                </entry>

</row>

<row>
<entry>&lt;default&gt;</entry>

<entry>The <literal>&lt;default&gt;</literal> element may 
appear below <literal>&lt;schema&gt;</literal> (a default for all
                  locales, often suitable for numeric values), 
<emphasis>OR</emphasis> below a <literal>&lt;locale&gt;</literal>
element, if the default should be localized. It simply contains the
                  default value for the keys the schema is applied to.
                  
                </entry>

</row>


<row>
<entry>&lt;locale&gt;</entry>

                <entry>
                  The <literal>&lt;locale&gt;</literal> element 
                  contains locale-specific data, including the
                  human-readable short and long descriptions, 
                  and optionally the default value
                  (<literal>&lt;default&gt;</literal> may also be
                  placed directly underneath the
                  <literal>&lt;schema&gt;</literal> element).
                  There should be one
                  <literal>&lt;locale&gt;</literal> element for each
                  locale, with a <literal>name</literal> attribute 
                  specifying the locale name.
                </entry>

</row>


</tbody></tgroup></informaltable>        

        A <literal>&lt;locale&gt;</literal> element can contain 
a locale-specific <literal>&lt;default&gt;</literal>, and may also 
contain short and long descriptions as follows:
<informaltable pgwide="1" frame="none">
<tgroup cols="2"><colspec colwidth="2*"/><colspec colwidth="8*"/>
<tbody>

<row>
<entry>&lt;short&gt;</entry>
<entry>A short description of the purpose of this key, around 
40 characters long (about half a line).
</entry>

</row>

<row>
<entry>&lt;long&gt;</entry>
<entry>A long description of the configuration key, around a paragraph
                  or two. Should describe the possible values of the 
key and their effect on the application.
</entry>

</row>
