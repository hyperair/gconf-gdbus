Description: GNOME configuration database system development files
 GConf is a configuration database system, functionally similar to the
 Windows registry but lots better. :-) It's being written for the GNOME
 desktop but does not require GNOME; configure should notice if GNOME is not
 installed and compile the basic GConf library anyway.
